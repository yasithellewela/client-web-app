The intention of the scholarship is to expose corporations&rsquo; increasing focus on profit and decreasing interest in employees&rsquo; well-being. The Investor&rsquo;s Podcast firmly believes that a highly profitable company shouldn&rsquo;t come at the expense of its employees&rsquo; happiness. We believe that sustainable profitability originates from the employees&rsquo; happiness, and that value creation for society and the individual starts with the employers&rsquo; genuine actions of showing how much they care.</p>\n<p>In your application, please elaborate on your ideal culture from your future employer.

We seek to make our listeners more effective, efficient, and happy.&nbsp;The finance culture is often a rude and greedy place. Confusion is encouraged to protect profits. The Investor&rsquo;s Podcast creates the exact opposite culture and community. When",
